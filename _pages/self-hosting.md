# Getting Started

First, create a new bot user by heading over to [https://discord.com/developers/](https://discord.com/developers/) and signing in with your Discord account. Create a new application, give it a name, and then click on "Bot" on the left side of the panel.

Then, give the bot a name and click the "copy" button under Token. This is your API token, and will be used later in the bot configuration. **Never reveal your API token to anyone!**

**Note:** Server Members Intent must be checked for activity logs to function properly.
